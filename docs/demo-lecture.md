Absolutely, that’s great to know! Since you already have a working demo for speech detection, ASR with FunASR, and TTS in Mandarin, we can integrate that into the backend design. It simplifies things since we know the language models and pipelines are already set up for Mandarin.

### Backend Design with Dora (with Existing ASR/TTS)

**1. High-Level Architecture Overview**
Since your ASR (FunASR) and TTS are already in place for Mandarin, the backend design can focus on:

* Integrating those existing components into the Dora dataflow.
* Managing the real-time interaction logic (how the AI responds to student questions).
* Hosting the curriculum logic on AWS and handling the flow of lecture content.

**2. Dora Dataflow Setup**

* **Input Node**: Capture student questions (text or voice) from the client. If it’s voice, run it through the existing FunASR to convert to text.
* **Question Processing Node**: Once the question is in text form, this node decides if it’s a simple clarification or if it requires a more complex response.
* **AI Response Node**: For simpler questions, the AI can respond immediately. For more complex questions, it might adjust the lecture flow or pull in additional content.
* **Output Node**: Send the AI’s response back to the client (as text to be displayed, or use the existing TTS to convert it back to speech).

**3. AWS Hosting**

* Use AWS EC2 to host the Dora dataflow and the main LLM.
* Store lecture materials (slides, additional resources) in S3.
* Use AWS Lambda for any on-demand processing (e.g., fetching extra educational content on the fly).

### Client-Side Design

**1. Frontend Framework**:
Build the client-side as a browser-based web app. Use HTML/CSS/JS with Reveal.js for slides. This allows for easy embedding of lecture content and a familiar environment for users.

**2. User Interaction**:
Allow students to type questions into a chat box or use a microphone button for voice input. For voice questions, use the Web Speech API to capture and send the audio to the backend where FunASR will handle the transcription.

**3. Real-Time Updates**:
As the AI responds, update the lecture content or display the AI’s answer in a chat bubble. This makes the lecture feel dynamic and interactive.

### Summary

* **Backend**: Use Dora to orchestrate the flow of lecture content, student questions, and AI responses. Integrate your existing FunASR and TTS for Mandarin support.
* **Frontend**: Use a browser-based web app with Reveal.js for slides, and Web Speech API for voice input. This keeps it simple and fast to implement.
