# Minimal English Podcast Script

Host: Welcome to our quick podcast update. I’m your host, here with a short briefing on edge computing.
Guest: Thanks for tuning in! I’ll walk through three takeaways every engineering team should know.
Host: First is low latency—processing data near the source keeps critical decisions fast.
Guest: Second, resilience. Distributed nodes reduce the blast radius of outages and keep services online.
Host: Finally, scalability. You can grow capacity node by node without rebuilding your data center.
Guest: That’s all for today. Thanks for listening and see you next time!
